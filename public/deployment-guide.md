# Chat Widget Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy and integrate the chat widget into any website.

## Step 1: Deploy the React App

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for Vercel (vercel.com)
3. Create a new project in Vercel and connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `VITE_VOICEFLOW_API_KEY`: Your Voiceflow API key
   - `VITE_VOICEFLOW_PROJECT_ID`: Your Voiceflow project ID
5. Deploy the application
6. Note the deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-chat-app.vercel.app`)

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for Netlify (netlify.com)
3. Create a new site from Git and connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure the environment variables as above
5. Deploy the application

### Option 3: Self-host
1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Host the `dist` folder on your web server
3. Make sure to configure CORS to allow requests from the domains where you'll embed the widget

## Step 2: Configure CORS Headers

Ensure your deployed chat application allows requests from the domains where you'll embed it:

1. If using Vercel, add a `vercel.json` file to your project:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "value": "*" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "value": "GET, POST, OPTIONS" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "value": "Content-Type" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. For Netlify, add a `_headers` file to your public folder:
```
/*
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

## Step 3: Update the Injection Script

1. Open the `injection-script.js` file
2. Replace the `CHAT_APP_URL` value with your deployed application URL:

```javascript
const CHAT_APP_URL = "https://sleek-faq-buddy.lovable.app"; // Replace with your actual URL
```

## Step 4: Add the Script to Your Website

Add the following script tag to the websites where you want to embed the chat widget:

```html
<script src="https://sleek-faq-buddy.lovable.app/injection-script.js"></script>
```

Or host the injection script separately and reference it:

```html
<script src="https://your-script-hosting.com/injection-script.js"></script>
```

## Step 5: Customize the Widget (Optional)

Edit the `injection-script.js` file to customize:

- Widget size and position
- Content scraping logic for your specific site structure
- Widget appearance

## Step 6: Test the Integration

1. Visit your website where the script is installed
2. Verify that:
   - The chat widget appears in the bottom right corner
   - The widget successfully loads
   - The widget receives the scraped page content
   - The chat bot responds correctly using the page content

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify CORS headers are properly set
3. Test the message passing between the parent page and iframe
4. Ensure your Voiceflow API key and project ID are correctly configured
5. Try adding '?debug=true' to your URL to enable additional console logging
